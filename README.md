# amazee.io Lagoon - Docker Build and Deploy System for OpenShift & Kubernetes

Lagoon solves what developers are dreaming about: A system that allows developers to locally develop their code and their services with Docker and run the exact same system in production. The same Docker images, the same service configurations and the same code.

Please reference our [documentation](https://lagoon.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information on using, developing, and administering Lagoon.
